# e-Vote
As the whole world is being digitalized, why not the voting system :)
This android application replicates the voting system but in an easier, faster and secured way sitting right on your sofa.

## Working

### Step:1 (Registration for new users)
This step is available only for the first time users. The user will be prompted to enter their name and PAN number for registration.
If the details are legit, the user can set their login id(email) and password. After registering, a 2 minutes video of the user will be recorded and a face model will be 
created by using separate frames of the video.

### Step:2 (Login)
If an user has already registerd, they will be prompted to login to their existing account.

### Step:4 (Dashboard)
After successful login, the user can access the Dashboard which incorporates the information about live elections, local parties, upcoming elections etc.

### Step:5 (Voting)
For voting, the user has to enter their login id and password. If the credentials are legit, the application prompts a face authentication to make sure the right person
is voting. The pictures from this authentication is matched with the face model created during registration and enables to user to vote their right.

## Pros

* Elderly people are able to vote without any adversity.
* Non-resident Indians and people who live far-off their polling centre can vote easily.
