# e-Vote
As the whole world is being digitalized, why not the voting system :)

This android application replicates the voting system but in an easier, faster and secured way sitting right on your sofa.

## Working

### Step:1 (Registration for new users)
This step if available only for the first time users. The user will have to enter their details such as name, email id(to send the KEY), PAN number, reason and file of proof on the e-Vote KEY generating website. The details will be cross checked with the original data. If the details are legit, a unique 10 digit alpha-numeric KEY will be generated for the user and KEY will be sent to user via email.


### Step:2 (Login)
Once the user receives the KEY via email, they can enter the credentials in the e-Vote application. If the credentials match, the user will be successfully logged into the e-Vote application

### Step:4 (Dashboard)
After successful login, the user can access the Dashboard which incorporates the information about live elections, local parties, election candidates, upcoming elections etc.

### Step:5 (Voting)
For voting, the user has to enter their unique KEY. If the credentials are legit, the user will be eligible to vote in the e-Vote application. To make sure there are no malpractices going on, the camera, mic and screen recording will be catptured while voting and will be verified.
